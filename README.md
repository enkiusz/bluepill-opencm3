# STM32F103 "Bluepill" Framework using libopencm3

This is based off of the [what Ross Schlaikjer did for CPP](https://rhye.org/post/stm32-with-opencm3-0-compiling-and-uploading/) but this for C. Also, some of the library calls didn't work and have been updated.

## Programming

You can easily used an ST-LINK programmer. I haven't been able to get the USB bootloader to work yet but you can also [use a USB-to-serial dongle](https://medium.com/@paramaggarwal/programming-an-stm32f103-board-using-usb-port-blue-pill-953cec0dbc86) using [stm32loader](https://github.com/jsnyder/stm32loader).
